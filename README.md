# RenderCraft

## Getting Started

### RenderCraft is an offline renderer based on ray-tracing method.

Now the features and functions are far from complete...

So I suggest that you browsed around my other libs and come back months later :)

If you are looking for some rendering stuff, then I suggest that you should see the lajolla I forked...

I use pugixml for xml parsing.

I use glm for 3D mathematics.
